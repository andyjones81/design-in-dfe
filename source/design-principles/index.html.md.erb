        <p>Accessibility must never be an afterthought or a task to do once you've got <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> out the door. You should be considering how you ensure services are accessible right from the start and throughout the design and delivery lifecycle.</p>
        <p>Designers creating user interactions and writing content, must consider who may be using the service, or may do in the future. If you know the service has a low number of disabled users than the national average, this may change in future, don't just design for now.</p>
        <p>Allowing our users to use services which are not accessible, makes the service harder to use, wastes time and money fixing problems in the future, and exposes us to unnecessary risk.</p>

        <p>Everything you are looking to design has probably already been designed elsewhere already, so make use of existing patterns and components.</p>
        <p>You should aim to design to established, industry best practice - users spend most of their time on other sites, so users will expect our services to work the same way as other sites they already use. </p>
        <p>When design behave the same, users won't have to learn something new, they know what will happen based on a familiar experience. Users will trust a service that feels familiar, even if what they are doing is nothing like another service or task they do elsewhere.</p>

<p>Overloading a page with UI elements such as buttons, unnecessary links, cards, graphical elements, can make it overwhelming and cause cognitive overload. Make best use of whitespace to make things easier to understand, navigate and use. </p>
<p>Some things in design are functional, others purely aesthetic. If they aren't adding to the overall experience, then remove it - reduce the design to the necessary features for the user to complete their task.</p>
<p>When writing content, write only what you need to. Make the main thing on a page, the most important thing the user needs to do or understand.</p>

<p>You should be designing service interactions, touchpoints and content based on knowlege of how and where the users of the service will use them. This is a key principle, applied through <a href="https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard/1-understand-user-needs.html" target="_blank"> Service Standard at Point 1 - Understand users and their needs</a> </p>
<p>Understanding users' circumstances, culture, language, abilities and capabilities, helps us to design services and content that works for everyone.</p>
<p>This doesn't only enable us to design inclusive services, it also enables us to mitigate biases we may design into our service unintentionally.</p>
<p>Provide information and functionality in context - at the point the user is most likely to need it. Save the user from having to hunt for it, or missing it altogether.</p>
