> Every Thursday between 1pm and 4pm is protected profession-time and is your time to learn and share.

Each profession runs sessions differently, but each one usually covers a talk, design crits or a learning session.

Meetings are 1pm to 2pm and rotate between professions on a weekly basis.

Join the profession channels on Slack and ask for an invite if you want to come along to one.
