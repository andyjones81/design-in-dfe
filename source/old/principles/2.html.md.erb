We need to design and deliver services that work for everyone, that are [inclusive](/inclusive-design.html) and accessible.

Designing for accessibly from the start reduces rework and time, is morally the right thing to do and is a legal requirement.

## Legislation

We will be breaking the law if we design services which are not accessible. The <a href="https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/accessibility/laws-and-standards.html" target="_blank">laws and regulations we are required to meet (opens in new tab)</a> are detailed in the Apply the Service Standard in DfE Manual.

## Good practice for accessibility

You should:

- [use sufficient background/foreground colour contrast](/principles/accessibility/minimum-contrast.html)
- use industry recommended sizes for interactive components
- [design structure into pages](/principles/accessibility/headings.html) (headings of different levels, lists...)
- [visually indicate the page focus](/principles/accessibility/focus.html)
- [avoid images of text](/principles/accessibility/alternative-meaning.html)
- [not represent information using just colour on its own](/principles/accessibility/color.html)
- find pains a user might have using a journey map to understand where the journey/paths are not easy to use by everyone
