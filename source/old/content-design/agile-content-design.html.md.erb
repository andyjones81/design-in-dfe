# Agile content design

## Working in an agile team

<%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery", "Agile")%> ways of working encourage teams to build quickly, test what they’ve built and iterate their work based on regular feedback and data.

Every product or service can vary, as can the team that delivers each stage. 

As a content designer, the following information gives an idea of what you should be focusing on at each stage.

## During discovery

To learn about your users, your subject and existing content: 

- find the words people use using Google Analytics, Adwords and Trends, online forums, social media 
- attend user research - observe user research sessions and take notes, meet users, observe how they interact with current services 
- find gaps or problems with existing content. Look at GOV.UK Feedex, helpline data and other existing feedback 
- work with stakeholders, policy and subject matter experts to build your knowledge of the subject and understand the policy intent
- review how existing content addresses user needs. Use GOV.UK, other online information, outbound letters and emails 
- write problem statements, mission statements and service descriptions to help your team define their focus  

## During alpha

To build prototypes, design and iterate content: 

- create and update prototypes with other UCD team members. Use Figma, GOV.UK prototype kit, Visual studio code, Heroku and Git
- write and test letters, text messages, emails and other notifications
- follow GOV.UK and DfE design patterns and styles. Share new patterns and research with other designers in DfE and across government 
- work with the digital communications team - DfE’s GOV.UK content team
- design GOV.UK start and done pages and test with users 
- test GOV.UK content with users to cover the whole journey 
- work with legal and security to understand constraints on content 
- share content and research for GOV.UK start, done and guidance pages to help business analysts and product owners to write clear user stories

## During private beta

To design the content for your first release: 

- design error and validation messages 
- show when the online service is unavailable 
- explain how the service uses cookies and collects personal data 
- write feedback questions to help the team learn about the user’s experience 
- translate content into Welsh, if neccessary. The Welsh language team can give you this 
- work with the digital communication team at DfE and the CDDO content team on GOV.UK start, done and guidance pages - for launch of public beta 
- write metadata descriptions and keywords to help users find the right service and improve search engine rankings 
- iterate content based on feedback from users, design hypotheses and analytics
- help your team to name the service 

## During live

To manage content: 

- continue to iterate the service content by using feedback and analytics to inform changes or discover new user needs to explore
- regularly review and audit content to ensure it remains relevant, up-to-date and continues to meet users’ needs
