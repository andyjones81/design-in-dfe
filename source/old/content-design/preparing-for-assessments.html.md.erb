# Preparing for assessment

To have a successful assessment, you will need to show:

- how you've mapped the user journeys in discovery
- evidence of design options to test in alpha
- how the design has been iterated based on research in beta 

You will also need to show:

- how the product will meet user needs and business needs
- the outcomes and how the product will deliver against these outcomes, in a sustainable and efficient way
- how you've identified the most efficient and effective way to deliver the right information at the right time in a way that users need it. This design must be sustainable and cost efficient to answer business requirements and user needs



## Talk about your service

During your assessment, tell the story about what you have done, instead of ticking off the standards one-by-one. Share what you have learnt and what you recommend for the next stage. 

To prepare for this, look at the checklists for each stage to see if your team is we meeting the standards. 

If your team is not meeting the standards, explain why. You should always present your evidence and recommendations clearly, even if this means your product may not move to the next stage.

All digital products with interactive or bespoke design should have some form of quality assurance. If your product is non-transactional and does not transfer data, then it will only need a peer review, rather than an assessment.
