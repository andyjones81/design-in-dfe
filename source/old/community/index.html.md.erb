# Design community

The design community is made up of the content, service and interaction design professions.

## Protected community time

Every Thursday between 1pm and 4pm is dedicated community profession time. This is protected from other work and is an opportunity to work with colleagues in your, or other professions to build community practice, work on objectives or other outcomes.
