## What inclusive design means

In short, inclusivity means design that is both representative and accessible.

If we use our own abilities and biases as a starting point, we end up with services designed for people of a specific gender, age, language ability, tech literacy, and physical ability.

Like accessibility, this includes individuals with physical or mental impairments, but it also goes much further than this. Inclusivity includes users of all ethnicities, backgrounds, gender, sexual orientation, and more into the user experience.

This will help you consider the types of people who may be using your service and who you should be testing with.")%>

## Writing inclusively

When we write, we may be introducing bias without realising it. We may also be using language that is gender specific when it shouldn't be.

You can use the inclusivity settings in Office 365 to check the language of content in documents.

## There's no such thing as a 'normal user'

The interactions we design with technology depend heavily on what we can see, hear, say, and touch.

Assuming all those senses and abilities are fully enabled all the time creates the potential to ignore many people who may have impairments with one or more of their senses.

Designing for inclusivity not only opens up Department for Education (DfE) services to more people with a wider range of abilities. It also reflects how people really are.

## Recognise exclusion in design

Exclusion happens when we solve problems or design solutions using our own biases.

There are different ways someone can be excluded from using a service through disability and is dependent on the context of how people are using the service.

There are three types of exclusion designers must consider when designing services, components and features.

### Temporary

Short term injury or context affects how users interact with the service. For example, having a broken arm may make it more difficult to use a phone, computer or mouse and keyboard.


### Situational

The situation a user finds themself in might mean they cannot use the service at that moment in time. For example, being in a loud environment might make it difficult to hear or speak to someone on the phone if they need help using a service.


### Permanent

Many people have a permanent disability and so designing for these users by default means the service will work for more people. For example, ensuring a service works with screen readers will work for a wide range of people.


## Build knowledge in diversity

Do not rely solely on simulating different abilities. For example, using blindfolds, earplugs or putting one hand behind your back, test the service with a wide range of users.

Having empathy for your users and learning how people adapt in different ways to using the service, you can better understand how to design for a wide range of abilities.

## Solve for one, works for all

Inclusive design means designing with consideration for many different circumstances.

However, ensuring the service works for blind users has the added benefit that it'll work for users with temporary vision issues using voice over or a screen reader.

Additionally, someone who might find it easier to listen to guidance or content rather than read it if they are cooking dinner or out for a walk.
