# Component design

When designing a new service, always start with what is available already. Check the [GOV.UK Design System](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/)  before designing anything new because those patterns and components have already been researched and tested to make sure they’re accessible.

If you design anything new, your team will have to do all of the user research and [accessibility testing and audit](/accessibility/audit.html) work to make sure that it is meeting the needs of your users and the accessibility standards.

If your service is only for staff or if won’t be GOV.UK branded, it is still recommended to use the GOV.UK Design System and its unbranded layout. You will still get the benefits of the accessibility work that has gone into it. For example resizing the screen, the line spacing and the components.

## Four stage acceptance criteria

If the GOV.UK Design System doesn't feature a component which you can use to meet a user need, you can use the 4 stage acceptance criteria to validate if building a new component is the right thing to do.

This does not stop new components from being created, but instead puts some checks in place to prevent over-engineering of service frontends.

1. [Can the problem be solved with existing components or patterns?](#can-the-problem-be-solved-with-existing-components-or-patterns)
2. [Does it meet user needs across multiple services?](#does-it-meet-user-needs-across-multiple-services)
3. [Does it add value to the user experience?](#does-it-add-value-to-the-user-experience)
4. [Is it accessible?](#is-it-accessible)

### 1. Can the problem be solved with existing components or patterns?

The primary look and feel for digital services is the [GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/) with available components, patterns and styles detailed in the [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/).

Where appropriate, contributions should be made back to the design system to support the development of components for other users. 

The [GOV.UK Design System backlog](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/projects/1) also contains components which are being considered or in development or have been built by other designers. 

If you decide the problem cannot be designed around by anything that exists in the design system, and it is a common problem, ask within DfE or Gov Digital slack channels to see if anyone else has designed for the same problem.

### 2. Does it meet user needs across multiple services?

Designers can often work in silos and as a result aren’t aware of what other designers across DfE are working on and designing. This becomes obvious, and a pain point, for users of multiple DfE services which have been designed and built by different teams. 

Using components consistently, sharing with other designers and understanding who the users are and which services they use, helps to provide a consistent experience of DfE services and will help you to meet the following standards:

-  <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/consistent-identification.html" target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">WCAG 3.2.4 (AA) - Consistent identification</a>


### 3. Does it add value to the user experience?

When designing a new component, you should be ensuring it is meeting a validated user need through user research activity. Designing components and features which meet user’s needs, should be shared so that other designers can use them in their services. 

Components and features shouldn’t be built or designed just to make something look aesthetically pleasing, but instead add value, solve a problem or make something complex, understandable.

### 4. Is it accessible?

Accessibility is non-negotiable. Any new components or features must meet the component design guidelines and be usable by people of all abilities. 

When considering a new component, it will often go through several iterations and design decisions will be made on what to take forward and what to discard, often through design crits, show and tells and user research. 

Involving a wide range of people in these decisions will ensure you are being inclusive in your design approach.
