# Ways of working

## Quality checks
You should have an agreed and documented quality checking process. 

Your process should:

- be appropriate for your service
- take into account different levels of changes. For example, typo, minor content update, policy change
- include how and when you conduct activities such as: 

  - 2i and peer reviews
  - fact checking
  - policy sign-off
  - communications

You should conduct your final quality checks on a preview of the content as it would appear once published. 


### Example workflow

The digital communications team (often referred to as DCT or digi comms) is an internal team that manage DfE’s content on GOV.UK. They support product teams with updates to GOV.UK content, start pages for services and campaign sites.

## Monitoring

We deliver continuous improvement, to do so we must:

  * monitor the performance of our content and services, this forms part of <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/running-your-service-in-a-sustainable-way", "maintaining a sustainable service")%>
  * <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success/how-to-set-performance-metrics-for-your-service", "set key performance indicators")%> (KPIs) and measure our content or service against those indicators on a regular basis
  * have a plan in place for how you will develop and test content through its life cycle
  * use Google Analytics, set up dashboards to measure against KPIs and set regular reports
  * build in feedback loops
  * identify ways to trigger alerts to issues with content and how to address them
  

## Content audit

You should conduct content audits on a regular basis to ensure your content remains relevant and up to date.

You may also conduct an audit ahead of developing new content or at the point when you identify an upcoming change, for example a policy update or new financial details.
