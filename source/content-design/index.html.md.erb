We work closely with the other <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/digital-data-and-technology-profession-capability-framework#user-centred-design-job-family", "user-centred design (UCD) professions")%>  on our team, including user research, service and interaction design, along with business analysts and developers to meet these standards.

## How we meet the Service Standard

As a content design profession, we agree to:

- evidence and document how we make design decisions <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design/research-and-evidence", "(tools and evidence to back up content design decisions) ")%>
- ensure content is accessible <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction", "(making your service accessible)")%>
- use the appropriate style and brand guide for the service or website 
- have a process in place to preview prior to publishing, such as a 2i, quality check and sign off content
- work to a strategy, and publish <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition/govuk-proposition", "a proposition statement - example for GOV.UK")%> where appropriate
- test with users through user research and by building prototypes
- work in collaboration with our user-centred design and policy colleagues to understand problems and create solutions
- always develop content that meets user needs
- set performance measures and monitor content against these measures <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/measuring-success", "(measuring success)")%> 
- have a plan in place to continuously iterate and improve
- work to the <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual", "service manual standards")%>
- work to the <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-proposition", "GOV.UK proposition")%>, where applicable 


## We follow government guidance 

As a starting point, we use:

- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service/about", "Government Digital Service")%> (GDS) build platforms, products and services for government
- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/central-digital-and-data-office/about", "Central Digital & Data Office")%> manage standards and service assessments for government. This includes the digital, data and technology function (DDaT) framework
- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/guidance/style-guide", "GDS style guide")%>  
- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/topic/government-digital-guidance/content-publishing", "GDS content and publishing guidance")%>  
- <%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual", "GDS Service Manual")%>  


## We also follow DfE guidance

We use DfE specific guidance when considering things like tone of voice, specific styles and how to publish in DfE.

<%= external_link("https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications.aspx", "How to communicate")%> is a section of our intranet that explains how we communicate at DfE, it includes:

- working with strategic and digital communications teams
- brand guidelines, including guidance on images and videos and document templates
- DfE style guide
- how to publish on GOV.UK
- how to produce content for different channels, such as our blogs or presentation for internal and external use
- <%= external_link("https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-make-your-content-accessible.aspx", "make your content accessible")%>

We have a <%= external_link("https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-dfe-govuk-content-strategy.aspx", "DfE content strategy")%> template, which should form the basis of individual product and service strategies.
