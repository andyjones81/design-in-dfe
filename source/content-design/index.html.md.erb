As content designers, we focus on these standards: 

1. understand users and their needs
2. solve a whole problem for users
3. provide a joined up experience across all channels
4. make the service simple to use
5. make sure everyone can use the service
8. iterate and improve frequently
10. define what success looks like and publish performance data 
11. choose the right tools and technology
