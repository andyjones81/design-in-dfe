# Agile content design

## Working in an agile team

Every product or service can vary, as can the team that delivers each stage. 

As a content designer, the following information give an idea of what you should be focusing on at each stage.

[Guide to agile delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery).


## During discovery

To learn about your users, your subject and existing content: 

- find the words people use using Google Analytics, Adwords and Trends, online forums, social media 
- attend user research - observe user research sessions and take notes, meet users, observe how they interact with current services 
- find gaps or problems with existing content. Look at GOV.UK Feedex, helpline data and other existing feedback 
- work with stakeholders, policy and subject matter experts to build your knowledge of the subject and understand the policy intent
- review how existing content addresses user needs. Use GOV.UK, other online information, outbound letters and emails 
- write problem statements, mission statements and service descriptions to help your team define their focus  

## During alpha

To build prototypes, design and iterate content: 

- create and update prototypes with other UCD team members. Use Figma, GOV.UK prototype kit, Visual studio code, Heroku and Git
- write and test letters, text messages, emails and other notifications
- follow GOV.UK and DfE design patterns and styles. Share new patterns and research with other designers in DfE and across government 
- work with the digital communications team - DfE’s GOV.UK content team
- design GOV.UK start and done pages and test with users 
- test GOV.UK content with users to cover the whole journey 
- work with legal and security to understand constraints on content 
- share content and research for GOV.UK start, done and guidance pages to help business analysts and product owners to write clear user stories

## During private beta

To design the content for your first release: 

- design error and validation messages 
- show when the online service is unavailable 
- explain how the service uses cookies and collects personal data 
- write feedback questions to help the team learn about the user’s experience 
- translate content into Welsh. The Welsh language team can give you this 
- work with the digital communication team at DfE and the CDDO content team on GOV.UK start, done and guidance pages - for launch of public beta 
- write metadata descriptions and keywords to help users find the right service and improve search engine rankings 
- iterate content based on feedback from users, design hypotheses and analytics
- help your team to name the service 

## During live
- continue to iterate the service content by using feedback and analytics to inform changes or discover new user needs to explore
- regularly review and audit content to ensure it remains relevant, up-to-date and continues to meet users’ needs
