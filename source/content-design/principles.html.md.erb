# Principles

As a content design community, we have agreed 5 principles for content design. 

## 1. Content has a purpose

We develop content based on evidence of user needs and deliver it to users in a way that meets these needs. 


## 2. Content is accessible


We get to know our audience through doing research with them. We write in a way that engages them using plain English. We develop content that meets the <%= external_link("https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/", "WCAG standards")%>. 

<%= external_link("https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/testing-for-accessibility", "Find out how to test your content ")%>


## 3. Content needs to change over time


We review our content regularly and keep it up to date. We remove content when we can evidence it is no longer needed and we continue to iterate content based on user feedback with an understanding that the users' needs change over time. 

Content should be monitored, any feedback addressed, and usefulness continuously checked and reviewed at last every 12 months. 


## 4. More content is not always the right solution


An important part of understanding user needs is understanding where and how we, in DfE, should address that need. We need to consider how appropriate the type of content is and if we can meet the user need on GOV.UK. 

If the need cannot be met on GOV.UK, we should consider the different ways we can share the content, for example email or blog post. Does this guidance actually need to become a service? (and conversely is this ‘service’ actually guidance?) Should this be published by someone else? Does the information already exist elsewhere?


## 5. Content starts with an audit


Before you introduce new content, you need to know what related content already exists.
