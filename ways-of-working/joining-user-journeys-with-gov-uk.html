<h1 id="joining-user-journeys-between-gov-uk-and-digital-services">Joining user journeys between GOV.UK and digital services</h1>
<p>To ensure a joined up journey for users between GOV.UK and DfE digital services, content designers work closely with the Digital Communications Team (DCT). The DCT create, publish and manage DfE&rsquo;s content on GOV.UK.</p>
<h2 id="designing-content-for-gov-uk">Designing content for GOV.UK</h2>
<p>When working with the DCT on DfE digital services, content designers:</p>

<ul>
<li>must work with <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-publish-gov-uk.aspx" target="_blank">the DCT (opens intranet page in new tab)</a> on any GOV.UK content. If you do not have access to the DfE intranet, ask a colleague with access to get the information for you</li>
<li>must prototype a version of any content as a minimum viable product (MVP) for non-transactional services on GOV.UK using <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/introduction-and-access-to-whitehall-publisher" target="_blank">Whitehall publisher (opens in new tab)</a>, the GOV.UK content management system</li>
<li>should map out journeys for services to show a user&rsquo;s journey</li>
</ul>
<p>Working in this way is part of how DfE content designers meet <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-3-join-up-across-channels" target="_blank">point 3 of the Service Standard to provide a joined up experience across all channels (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="request-a-whitehall-publisher-account">Request a Whitehall publisher account</h3>
<p>You will need a Whitehall publisher account to publish content on GOV.UK.</p>
<p>You can request access to Whitehall publisher training or accounts by <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/security-assurance.aspx" target="_blank">raising a request with DCT (opens intranet page in new tab)</a>. If you&rsquo;re a contractor you should ask a civil servant to make this request for you.</p>
<h2 id="providing-a-joined-up-experience-across-all-channels">Providing a joined up experience across all channels</h2>
<p>GOV.UK is a central publishing platform with services attached to it. Most users start their journey by reading some information before entering into a digital service. Content designers working on different parts of a journey should think about joined up services as users understand them, instead of as isolated transactions.</p>
<p>At DfE, DCT content designers generally work on GOV.UK content. Content designers working on a digital service that joins up to GOV.UK should work with DCT.</p>
<p>DCT use Whitehall publisher to manage DfE&rsquo;s GOV.UK content. Other DfE content designers may be given access to Whitehall but they should follow the <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-dfe-govuk-content-strategy.aspx" target="_blank">DfE GOV.UK content management process (opens intranet page in new tab)</a> and work with them to publish any GOV.UK content.</p>
<h3 id="examples-of-joined-up-journeys-between-gov-uk-guidance-and-digital-services">Examples of joined up journeys between GOV.UK guidance and digital services</h3>

</ul>
<h3 id="prototype-non-transactional-services-using-whitehall">Prototype non-transactional services using Whitehall</h3>
<p>If you’re working on a non-transactional or information service at DfE, you must prototype a MVP version of this on GOV.UK using Whitehall publisher. You must work with DCT when you do this.</p>
<p>GOV.UK definition of a non-transactional service as something that:</p>

<ul>
<li>uses interactivity to provide information with more specificity than static web pages. Content may also be interactive where there is dynamic delivery but where no information is stored or recorded. For example calculators, decision-trees and smart answers. This could also be called an interactive service as there is some interactivity though no actual transactions take place.</li>
</ul>
<p>GOV.UK definition of an information service as something that:</p>

<ul>
<li>provides users information in the form of guidance or marketing content. It may include dynamically-served content, content with data points included, or services that appear to the content consumer to be static pages but are aggregated by the CMS from content components. In other words, there is no opportunity for users to interact with the content other than to read it.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="map-out-your-service-journeys">Map out your service journeys</h3>
<p>You should map out journeys so that you understand a user&rsquo;s navigation through a service, including which interactions happen outside of the service as part of completing a journey.</p>
<p>A service journey map creates a timeline of the user&rsquo;s touchpoints. They&rsquo;re useful for understanding where a user interacts with content and the different elements of a service that the content needs to be consistent with.</p>
<p>Mapping out journeys helps you understand the user&rsquo;s steps and helps to create a consistent and smooth user journey between GOV.UK guidance and a digital service.</p>
<p>Even if you&rsquo;re not using GOV.UK to create a digital service, you should try to include any GOV.UK guidance content that supports the service as part of user testing.</p>

<p>There are different methods for creating user journey maps, read about <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2016/04/21/how-to-make-a-user-journey-map/" target="_blank">how to make a user journey map (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
<h2 id="work-with-dct-on-gov-uk-content">Work with DCT on GOV.UK content</h2>
<p>You must work with DCT on any content planned for GOV.UK. If you&rsquo;ve been given access to a Whitehall account, you&rsquo;ll usually be able to buddy up with a DCT content designer to support you through to publishing.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve not been given a buddy, you should still be able to work with DCT by:</p>

<ul>
<li>getting an induction from DCT</li>
<li>getting a 2i check from a DCT content designer before publishing</li>
<li>getting the right clearances</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="buddy-up-on-gov-uk-journeys">Buddy up on GOV.UK journeys</h3>
<p>Buddying up is where a DCT content designer supports a DfE content designer through DCT publishing processes and collaborates on content design decisions.</p>
<p>Buddying up should be done when content designers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>working on content that&rsquo;s planned to go on GOV.UK </li>
<li>testing content in Whitehall as part of checking whether an information service should be built that does not sit on GOV.UK</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="get-an-induction-from-dct-if-you-39-re-using-whitehall">Get an induction from DCT if you&rsquo;re using Whitehall</h3>
<p>Get an induction from DCT if you&rsquo;ve been given a Whitehall publisher account to work on GOV.UK content to get an overview of DfE processes for GOV.UK content, including 2i checks and clearances.</p>
<h3 id="get-a-2i-from-dct">Get a 2i from DCT</h3>
<p>Before it&rsquo;s published, all GOV.UK content needs to be checked by a DCT content designer to make sure it&rsquo;s accessible and follows the GOV.UK style guide.</p>
<p>A 2i is a where a DCT content designer reviews the final draft of content in-line with the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/reviewing-and-approving-content" target="_blank">GOV.UK 2i checklist (opens in new tab)</a> prior to publishing.</p>
<p>A 2i is different to a peer review. Peer reviews can be done at any stage of the drafting process. Content which will be published on GOV.UK should be peer reviewed by a content designer from the DCT.</p>
<h3 id="get-the-right-clearances">Get the right clearances</h3>
<p>DfE has strict clearance requirements for all GOV.UK publishing. This usually involves clearance from a Deputy Director (DD) and for high profile content, from strategic communications at DfE.</p>
<p>You may need to agree a publication date for certain content. This is to ensure the planning team know when the content will be published and if there are likely to be communication implications, such as media interest or questions.</p>
<p>Find out more on the intranet about <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-publish-gov-uk.aspx" target="_blank">DfE clearance processes for GOV.UK content (opens intranet page in new tab)</a>. If you do not have access to the DfE intranet, ask a colleague with access to get the information for you.</p>
<p>DCT will publish the content to GOV.UK after 2i checks have been completed and clearances have been confirmed.</p>
<h2 id="before-you-make-a-request-for-whitehall-publisher">Before you make a request for Whitehall publisher</h2>
<p>Make sure you&rsquo;ve spoken to DCT so they can help you decide if a request should be made and what kind of access is needed.</p>
<p>Content designers need to complete GDS training to use Whitehall. To ask for training, <a href="https://educationgovuk.sharepoint.com/sites/how-do-i/SitePages/communications-publish-gov-uk.aspx" target="_blank">submit a request (opens intranet page in new tab)</a>. If you do not have access to the DfE intranet, ask a colleague with access to submit a request for you.</p>
<h3 id="other-uses-of-whitehall">Other uses of Whitehall</h3>
<p>Whitehall accounts also give individuals access to Integration, the test version of GOV.UK that can be used to prototype content. There are other ways to prototype content, so a Whitehall account cannot be given out just for this use.</p>
<p>To look at data and insight about GOV.UK you can request access to GOV.UK Sign-on. It&rsquo;s different to a Whitehall publisher account but it still gives you access to:</p>

<ul>
<li>content data - for analytics about GOV.UK </li>
<li>feedex data - for user comments on content</li>
</ul>
